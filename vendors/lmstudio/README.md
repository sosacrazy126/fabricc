# LM Studio Integration for Fabric

This document provides a comprehensive guide to integrating **LM Studio** with **Fabric**, allowing users to run local language models seamlessly within their AI workflows as an alternative to cloud-based AI services.

## Introduction

**LM Studio** is a powerful platform for running language models locally. By integrating LM Studio with Fabric, users can efficiently incorporate these local models into their workflows, ensuring data privacy and reducing latency compared to cloud-based services.

## Setup

To begin using LM Studio with Fabric, follow these steps:

### 1. Install LM Studio
- Download and install LM Studio from the [official LM Studio website](https://lmstudio.ai/).
  
### 2. Start LM Studio
- Launch LM Studio and confirm it is running on your machine.

### 3. Configure Fabric for LM Studio Integration
- Run the Fabric setup process:
   ```bash
   fabric --setup
   ```

### 4. Configure LM Studio
- During setup, you'll be prompted to configure LM Studio as the model backend.
- Provide the **API Base URL** for your LM Studio instance, which defaults to `http://localhost:1234/v1`.

### 5. Verify Configuration
- After the setup, ensure that LM Studio is properly integrated by listing available models (details in the **Usage** section).

---

## Usage

Once LM Studio is set up, you can start using it within Fabric workflows.

### Listing Models
To view the available models in LM Studio:
```bash
fabric --listmodels
```

### Running a Model
To run a specific model for a task like summarization, use the following format:

```bash
fabric -m lmstudio -p summarize "Your text here" --model "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf"
```

- The `-m` flag specifies LM Studio as the backend.
- The `-p` flag defines the task (e.g., `summarize`, `classify`).
- The `--model` flag provides the path to the specific model you want to use.

### Example
```bash
fabric -m lmstudio -p summarize "Analyze the financial report for key takeaways." --model "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf"
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup or operation, follow these steps:

### 1. Check LM Studio Status
Ensure that LM Studio is running and accessible at the API Base URL (`http://localhost:1234/v1`).

### 2. Review Logs
Check LM Studio logs for error messages that may indicate issues with the model or API.

### 3. Model Verification
Confirm that the model you're attempting to use is properly loaded in LM Studio.

### 4. Increase Timeout
If you're experiencing timeouts, try increasing the timeout setting in Fabric or optimizing LM Studio's performance.

### Debug Logging
To enable detailed logging in Fabric for advanced troubleshooting, use the debug flag:
```bash
fabric --debug
```

## Limitations

- **Streaming Responses**: LM Studio integration currently does not support streaming responses. You will receive the full response after the task completes.
